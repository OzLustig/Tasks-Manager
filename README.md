### Prerequisites

- I used webstorm to edit/test and run my code. (https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) but you can use any text editor of your choice as long as you have node installed on your machine.
- Take a look at my pacjage.json file for dependencies:
    - "cookie-parser": "~1.4.3"
    - "debug": "~2.6.9"
    - "express": "~4.16.0"
    - "express-session": "^1.15.6"
    - "http-errors": "~1.6.2"
    - "jade": "~1.11.0"
    - "mongoose": "^5.2.8"
  make sure your install all of the dependencies first.

## Deployment

I've used heroku in order to deploy this application. (https://dashboard.heroku.com)
Follow their guidelines in order to simply deploy your application.
